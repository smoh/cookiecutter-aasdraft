# Cookiecutter-aasdraft

Quickstart a paper in AASTeX6.1 with this minimal cookiecutter template.

Once you have [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed,
simply do
```
cookiecutter https://github.com/smoh/cookiecutter-aasdraft
```

You will be asked to set directory name, tex file name, paper title, and authors, and you're good to go.

The following will be created:
```
├── Makefile
├── aasjournal.bst
├── aastex61.cls
├── figures/
└── [filename].tex
```
